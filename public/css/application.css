/****************************************************\

APPLICATION-SPECIFIC STYLING should be included in this
stylesheet. Link this sheet *after* the jeffstrap.css
sheet, to help ensure that any conflicts between that
stylesheet and this one are resolved in favor of this one.
Also, use classes as selectors in this stylesheet, so that
CSS's specificity rules will give these styles priority
over those in jeffstrap.css, which use tags as selectors
(almost) exclusively.
